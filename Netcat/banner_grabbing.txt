According to Cybersecurity by Thomas Mowbray, a banner is the first reseponse a service makes 
after a TCP connection is made to an open port. 

Banner grabbing is the process of sending requests to a server specifically to gather the 
information in the returned banner. This process is often used by penetration testers during 
the information gathering phase to gain valuable insight on the target server. 


The command to grab a banner using netcat is:

			echo "" | netcat -n -v -w1 [target_server_IP] port_#

A rundown of the options:

				-n : Numeric-only IP addresses, no DNS
				-v : Verbose output (Use twice to be more verbose)
				-w1: Timeout for connects and final net reads

When I run this command on the HTTP port against remoteTwo, I get valuable information 
back about the server including: the server operating system, server program and its 
version, among other things.
