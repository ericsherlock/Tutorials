The first thing we'll do is create simple TCP connection between two different hosts.

For this video I have multiple remote VMs that I'll be testing against. I have added an entry 
into my /etc/hosts file that maps my cloud server IP addresses to the names 'remoteVM' and
'remoteTwo'. Here, I'll use the names in the hosts file and their corresponding IPs analogously.

The following command with no options intitiates a simple TCP connection to a specified 
server on a particular port (I configured my SSH daemon to run on port 5123):

					netcat [options] host_IP port

When I attempt to connect to my server on that port, you can see it returns 
an SSH output message upon connection.

A few other commonly used options include: 
			-e filename  --> Specify filename to execute after successful connection.
			-l           --> Listen for inbound connections
			-t           --> enables telnet negotiation
			-u           --> UDP Mode 
			-z           --> Zero-I/O mode, used for scanning
