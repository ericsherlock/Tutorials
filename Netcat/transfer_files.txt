Now we are going to look at transfering files between two hosts using Netcat.
In order to accomplish this we need to set up one host to listen for connections, 
while we set up the other host to establish a connection. Here, I'll be setting up
my remote server to listen on port 4343. 


The following command syntax will open a listener on my remote server:

		REMOTE SERVER:		netcat -l -p 'port_#'  

I'll be connecting to my remote server using:

		CLIENT:			netcat 'remote_VM_IP' 'port_#'


Upon successful connection, it can be seen that it acts as a simple IM service. 
When I type in the console on one screen and press enter, that output appear on the 
other screen. Thus, we have successfully connected our servers through netcat. 

We can use this same functionality to create a file transfer tool. To accomplish this 
we need to do 2 things:

				1) We need our listener to forward any input it receives into a file
				2) We need to input our file contents to the netcat command to send 
						the file through our connection. 

The following command sets up our listener to forward any given input to a file:

		REMOTE SERVER:		netcat -l -p 'port_#' > receiving

While the next command inputs the file contents into the netcat command (we'll quickly
make a file called sending containing a small text message):

		CLIENT:  				netcat 'remote_VM_IP' 'port_#' < sending

When I run these commands, I get a new file on my remote server called 'receiving' and it
has the file contents that I put into sending.
