Port scanning with netcat is done using the -z option. If you want more information on port
scanning I go over it in my NMap video, link in description. 

The command is as follows: 

					netcat -z 'scan_target_IP' 'Port_range'

Often times the '-v' option is added after the '-z' option to specify a verbose output.

If I run a port scan on a remote server, you can see from my output, this process 
is rather slow. It's recommended that for larger jobs you use a dedicated scanning 
tool like NMap instead.
