Hey Everyone!

In this video we'll be going through a tutorial on the popular networking utility: Netcat. 

Originally created by an engineer called "The Hobit" (available for contact at: hobbit@avian.org)
for UNIX systems and released in 1996, Netcat is often refered to as the "Swizz Army Knife" of 
Linux networking tools. 

According to the manual page, Netcat "reads and writes data across network connections, 
using TCP and UDP protocol. It is designed to be a reliable back-end tool that can be 
used directly or easily driven by other programs and scripts."

Netcat is often on "Top 10" lists for networking-based and penetration testing tools due to 
its versatility and effectivness. Generally, it comes pre-installed on virtually all Linux 
OS distributions. A few of the more popular features include:

		--> Create TCP / UDP connections
		--> Port Scanning
		--> Transferring and Executing files
		--> Banner Grabbing
		--> Installing backdoors

In this walkthrough I'll demonstrate each of the capabilities mentioned above and introduce 
a few other features along the way. 

On the screen you'll see 3 different terminals. 

The current terminal will show the commands I'm running and explain how they're working. 

The top-right terminal is an open ssh connection to a virtual server that we'll be working with. 

The bottom-right terminal is a shell open on the current ParrosOS system that I'll be running 
my commands out of.

Let's get started!
