Our last step will be to install PHP. According to the PHP manual (www.php.net/manual)
PHP is an open source general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited for
web developemnt and can be embedded into HTML. 

PHP is generally focused as a server-side scripting language but can also be used for 
command line scripting and regular desktop applications and can be used on a wide variety 
of operating systems. 

For our purposes, we will mainly use PHP to do back-end work like accessing the database.

To install PHP, you can run the following:

			sudo yum install php php-mysql

You can also install a number of libraries that can provide specialized development tools,
frameworks, and APIs. You can list them with the following:

			sudo yum search php-

You can test PHP by creating a small info.php script. Add the following code into a
file in /var/www/html/info.php: 

<?php
phpinfo();
?>

Before we can test our PHP installation. We need to restart httpd so that Apache can 
be made aware of the recent addition of PHP. We can do this with:

			sudo systemctl restart httpd

You can open a web browser and navigate to your PHP script at your server's IP address. 
So for me, it will be  http://192.168.1.119/info.php   For you it will look like:

				http://your_server_ip/info.php

If you see a PHP info screen, you have succesfully installed PHP on your server.
