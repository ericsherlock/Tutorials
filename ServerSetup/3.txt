Now that we know what our goal here is we can begin installing our LAMP stack. 

**NOTE: Generally, one of the first things you should do with a clean install of
	any Linux operating system is install any updates that may be available. This 
	process can take a few minutes, so I did this previously to save some time.
	You can update with the following command:

			sudo yum update


First, let's install apache:

			sudo yum install httpd

Once it's installed, you can check its status with:
	
			sudo systemctl status httpd

Because it's a new install, it should not be running. We can start it with:

			sudo service httpd start

Now if we check the status again, Apache should be active. Although this won't be persistant.
If we want it to continue to run through reboots, we will need to enable the service with:

			sudo systemctl enable httpd

One thing to note is that CentOS 7 comes with Firewalld enabled. This means before we can 
see the test page for our Apache server, we need to allow access to the HTTP service in 
the public zone of our firewall. We can do this with the following command:

			sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-service=http

Let's reload the firewall for the changes to take effect.

			sudo firewall-cmd --reload
