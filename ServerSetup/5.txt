Next, we will install our database: MariaDB. You can use the following command:

			sudo yum install mariadb-server

Once it's finished installing we can check the status with:

			sudo systemctl status mariadb

It should not be running, so we can start it with:
			
			sudo systemctl start mariadb

Let's check the status again to make sure it has been started.
If we want it to continue to run through reboots, we will need to enable the service with:

			sudo systemctl enable mariadb

Now we can go over some basic configuration options by running the following:

			sudo mysql_secure_installation

This will have you step through some different prompts. You can set your own preferences
Or you can follow along with me. Because this is for demonstration purposes I will not be 
setting a password. 

--> Enter current password for root (enter for none): your_password_here
--> Set root password? [Y/n] 'y' if you set a password in last step, 'n' otherwise
--> Remove anonymous users? [Y/n] y
--> Disallow root login remotely? [Y/n] y
--> Remove test database and access to it? [Y/n] y
--> Reload privilege tables now? [Y/n] y

We can now access MariaDB from the command line with the following command:

			sudo mysql -u root -p

**NOTE: Because MariaDB is an open-source fork of MySQL, it provides an SQL 
interface for accessing the data within the MariaDB databases. As a result,
MySQL commands are still used in multiple instances when using MariaDB.
