Hey Everyone, 

In this video we will be installing and configuring a LAMP (Linux, Apache, 
MySQL, PHP) stack on a fresh install of CentOS 7.

In the window to the right is an SSH connection to a brand new updated 
install of of CentOS 7. The packages I have installed is the net-tools 
package which installs some basic networking tools and the standard 
VIM text editor. 

First, we'll cover some background information on each of the services 
above and how they work with each other. Then, we'll go over how to install
each component onto a new install of CentOS 7.
