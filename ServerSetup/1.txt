For some background information, let's go over the individual components of the LAMP stack:

L) The Linux part of our stack is covered by our using CentOS. According to the CentOS Project 
website (www.centos.org), CentOS is a stable, predictable, manageable and reproudcible
platform derived from the sources of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). 

A) According to the Linux Bible by Christopher Negus, Apache HTTP provides the service with 
which the client web browsers communicate. The daemon process runs in the background on 
your server and waits for requests from web clients. Web browsers provide those connections 
to the HTTP daemon and send requests, which the daemon interprets, sending back the appropriate data. 

M) The 'M' in the LAMP stack is for MySQL but for this video I will be using MariaDB instead.
According to mariadb.org, MariaDB is an open-source software and as a relational database it provides
an SQL interface for accessing data. MariaDB was developed by the same engineers who developed the 
original SQL. The goal was for MariaDB to be a completely open-source replacement for SQL after it was
aquired by Oracle.  

P) Accoring to php.net, PHP is a widely-used open source general-purpose scripting language that
is especially suited for web development and can be embedded into HTML. PHP allows the server to
generate dynamic output. While PHP is often used, you can also use other scripting languages like
Perl or Python to acheive similar results.
