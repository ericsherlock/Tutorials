Now back on our LAMP stack, you can test your Apache installation by opening a web 
browser and typing your server IP into the URL bar. If set up correctly, you should 
see an apache test page. For me, I'll navigate to http://192.168.1.119   Where you 
will replace my IP with the IP of your server.  

If you are able to see the apache test web page, then you have successfully installed
the apache web server.
