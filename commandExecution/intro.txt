Hey, Everyone.

This will be a simple demonstration of command execution on a vulnerable web server.
We'll be using a CENTOS 7 virtual machine with Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA)
as our victim server and a ParrotOS virtual machine as the attacker.

To the right you will see a webpage that pings an address. Above you'll see an SSH shell
to the vulnerable server.
