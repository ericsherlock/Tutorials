Hey Everyone,

       Today we will be learning how to scan a web server for vulnerabilities using Nikto.
	   We'll also be using Burpsuite to examine the requests between Nikto and our web server.

       According to the man pages:
             
              --> Nikto examines a web server to find potential problems and security vulnerabilities
                   including server and software misconfigurations, default files and programs, outdated 
                   servers and programs.
