Nikto can be a useful tool for both system administrators trying to patch possible vulnerabilities
and for penetration testers searching for those vulnerabilities.   

Nikto works by making continuous requests to a web server and evaluating the responses it receives.   

Please note: ***************NIKTO IS NOT A STEALTHY TOOL!************************

As we will see, scanning with Nikto leaves an extensive log-trail. This could be a problem for 
penetration testers who need to maintain anonymity in their operations. Later in the video
we will see how we can mitigate the chances of being detected.
