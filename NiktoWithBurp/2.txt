The vulnerable web server we'll be scanning is a CENTOS 7 virtual machine (VM) installed with the 
Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA). 

*****Note that I set up and own the VM that we will be scanning. If you plan on performing any 
penetration testing operations on a server, you should either own the server or have 
written permission by the owners to be perform any testing.*****

The machine running the scan will be a ParrotOS virtual machine installed with Nikto and BurpSuite. 

Here, ParrotOS (or Kali) comes with both Nikto and BurpSuite pre-installed.
If you are not using ParrotOS or Kali, then you can install them using the 
following commands (depending on which flavor Linux you are using):
                                
                Debian: 
				--> Nikto:
						 apt-get install nikto
				--> BurpSuite:
						apt-get install burpsuite
					
                RedHat:
				--> Nikto:
						dnf install nikto
				--> BurpSuite: On RedHat Systems must be downloaded / installed from source:
