Now, we can run our Nikto scan again and see the requests coming in BurpSuite.
Running the command: 

			nikto -useproxy http://localhost:8080 -h 192.168.1.160

We can see BurpSuite starting to intercept the packets. (Immediately forward
the first few so that Nikto doesn't error out due to lack of response). 

If we continuously forward the packets, we can see each request as they
are made. You can see Nikto makes thousands of GET/POST requests. Many of
which will return 404 not found errors. The rest of the responses will be 
inspected for vulnerabilities.
