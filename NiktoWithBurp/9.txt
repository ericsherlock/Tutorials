In this video we demonstrated the web server vulnerability scanner Nikto. 

Nikto can be extremely useful for system administrators who need to find / fix any possible vulnerabilities.

Likewise, it can be used by penetration testers to discover vulnerabilities on a web server.
Although, with a large number of GET / POST requests, a Nikto scan is extensively logged on 
the vulnerable server. To help mitigate this, you can route the Nikto traffic through a web proxy.

That's it for now. 

Thanks for watching!
