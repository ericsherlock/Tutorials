Rather than trying to be stealthy and hide our scans entirely, Nikto allows us to route our
traffic through a web proxy with the '-useproxy' option. This will allow us to scan 
the vulnerable server THROUGH another server, thus masking our IP address.

For the purposes of this video, we'll be using localhost as our proxy (so the IP will
be the same in the vulnerable server logs).

This will also allow us to use BurpSuite to look at the Nikto requests as they happen. So first,
open BurpSuite to a new temporary project and make sure 'Intercept is on' is active.
