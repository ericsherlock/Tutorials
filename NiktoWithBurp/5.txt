Looking more closely, we can see that Nikto made 8,000+ requests to our web server. 
As previously stated, Nikto is not a quiet tool. So let's look at the log files on 
our vulnerable server (open through SSH connection) and see what was logged.

The log files that handle http access requests are located in /var/log/httpd directory.
 More specifically, in the access_log files. 

We can print out the end of our access_log file using the command:
                                    
				 tail -100 /var/log/httpd/access_log

It is clear that our Nikto scan has a considerable footprint. Along with the thousands 
of GET/POST requests, we can see that each request came from our ParrotOS's IP address 
and that we are using Nikto to send these requests (again, Nikto is not a quite tool 
and should only be run against machines you have proper authorization to scan).
