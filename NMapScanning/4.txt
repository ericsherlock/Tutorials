Ping Only scan:	

		nmap -sn [target_IP or target_IP Range]

--> Used to perform a simple ping of the specified target without scanning any ports. Good for 
performing quick searches of the target network to see which hosts are online.

**Specify DNS Server

		nmap --dns-servers [server1, server2,..] [target_IP]

--> The --dns-servers option specifies which DNS servers to be queried when scanning.

Trace Network Path (Traceroute)

		nmap --traceroute [target_IP]

--> Simply trace and print the network path to the target host.

Scan Specific Ports

		nmap -p [target_port(s)] [target_IP]

--> Specify exactly which ports to scan. Instead of specifying the target ports, you can also 
put the port service. For example, instead of 'nmap -p 22 111.222.333.444' you can write
'nmap -p ssh 111.222.333.444'.

Agressive Scan	
		nmap -A [target_IP]

--> Agressive scans choose the most commonly used nmap options and automatically adds them to the 
nmap command. This is generally used for user convinience. When it finishes we'll see it did 
some common scans like traceroute and OS detection. But it causes a lot of activity and is not 
very well hidden.
