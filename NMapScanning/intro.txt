Hey Everyone, 

In this video we’ll be walking through how to use the popular network mapping tool NMAP. To begin I'll 
cover some background information on NMAP. Then, I’ll test multiple use cases on a CentOS web server 
starting with a simple nmap scan, scanning a range of IPs, and testing a range of discovery options 
including:
	
	- Ping scanning
	- DNS scanning
	- Operating system detection
	- Evading Firewalls

Let’s begin!
