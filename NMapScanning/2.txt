On the screen you will find 3 terminals. 

The top right terminal is a shell open to my current ParrotOS system that I'll be scanning from.

The bottom right terminal is an SSH connection to the server I'll be scanning. In order to see the 
NMAP connection attempts, I am running a Netcat listener to monitor certain ports that I know will
be scanned by NMAP. The ports I'm monitoring access attempts to are: 22, 443, 1234. For clarity, 
the tab-port mapping is as follows: 

		Tab 1 --> Port 22 
		Tab 2 --> Port 443
		Tab 3 --> Port 1234

The Netcat command I'll be using to monitor each port is: 

		nc -l -v -p [PORT #] -k

Here is a rundown of the command: 
	
		nc    --> Netcat command
		-l    --> Set up listener
		-v    --> Display verbose output
		-p    --> Designate port to listen to
		-k    --> Keep the listener open

The current terminal will be showing each of the NMAP command and syntax along with an explanation 
of what they're doing. 

Let's begin!
