Now we can begin adding data into our database tables. To insert data into a table, the command is as 
follows: 

		INSERT INTO tablename (field1, field2,...) VALUES (value1, value2, ....)

Similarly, To delete data from a table:

		DELETE FROM table_name [WHERE...] column_name = column_value

It should be noted that this command will delete the entire row that the column-value was located.

To get information on particular row:

		SELECT field, field2,... FROM table_name, table_name2,... WHERE column_name = column_value

These are the 3 main commands that you will need to fill and manage your database. There are more
intricate queries that can allow you to fine-grain any operations your looking to complete. Moreover,
there are multiple resources that go much further in depth, here are some good ones online:
