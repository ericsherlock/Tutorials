This will have you step through some different prompts. You can set your own preferences or you can 
follow along with me. 

--> Enter current password for root (enter for none): your_password_here
--> Set root password? [Y/n] 'y' if you set a password in last step, 'n' otherwise
--> Remove anonymous users? [Y/n] y
--> Disallow root login remotely? [Y/n] y
--> Remove test database and access to it? [Y/n] y
--> Reload privilege tables now? [Y/n] y

We can now access MariaDB from the command line with the following command:

			sudo mysql -u root -p

**NOTE: Because MariaDB is an open-source fork of MySQL, it provides an SQL 
interface for accessing the data within the MariaDB databases. As a result,
MySQL commands are still used in multiple instances when using MariaDB. 

Now, before continuing we should cover the primary and foreign keys concepts. This 
is because when we create a table we'll need to add options to our commands to 
incorperate primary/foreign keys into our database.
