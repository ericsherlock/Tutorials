Now, we can begin creating our database. If you haven't already, sign into MariaDB with the following:

			mysql -u root -p

To create the initial database use:

			CREATE DATABASE your_db_name;

You can create your own database or you can follow along with my example database commands in the bottom 
right terminal. For the purposes of this video, I'll be focusing my database around Avengers movies. So 
I'll call my database 'movies'. It will have 3 tables. A movie_info table to hold the title, director,
and release year. A movie_stats table to hold the title, earnings, and runtime. Lastly, a movie_quotes
table to hold the title, movie quote, and actor who said the quote. 

Now you'll want to create tables for your database. Tables are the structures that hold and 
organize your data into rows and columns within a database. Each column will represent a different 
piece of data you are storing and its corresponding datatype.

If you haven't already, move into your newly created database with:

			use your_db_name;

To create a table, the following command is used: 

			CREATE TABLE your_table_name (column-name1 column-type1, column-name2 column-type2,...);

In order to add a Primary Key to this table, simply add the primary key option in the CREATE command like so: 
		
			CREATE TABLE your_table_name (column-name1 column-type1, column-name2 column-type2,...)
				constraint [constraint-name] PRIMARY KEY (column1, column2,...);

The same command syntax is used to add foreign keys as well: 
	
			CREATE TABLE your_table_name (column-name1 column-type1, column-name2 column-type2, ...)
				CONSTRAINT [constraint-name] FOREIGN KEY (column1, column2,...) 
				REFERENCES your_table_name (primary_key_column);

Similarly, to drop or delete a table you can use: 
			
			DROP TABLE your_table_name;
