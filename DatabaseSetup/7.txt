Now that we have some data. We can go over how to query data using our primary and foreign keys.
First, we need to go over MariaDB "Joins". The three types of JOIN operations are: 
	
	1) INNER JOIN: Returns all rows from multiple tables where join condition is satisfied.

		SELECT column_name
		FROM table_name
		INNER JOIN table_name2
		ON table_name.column = table_name2.column
	
	2) LEFT OUTER JOIN: Return all rows from left-hand table specified in the ON condition
		and only those rows from the other table where joined condition is satisfied.

		SELECT column_name
		FROM table_name
		LEFT[OUTER] JOIN table_name2
		ON table_name.column_name = table_name2.column_name;

	3) RIGHT OUTER JOIN: Return all rows from  right-hand table specified in the ON condition
		and only those rows from the other table where the joined fields are satisfied. 


		SELECT column_name 
		FROM table_name 
		RIGHT[OUTER] JOIN table_name2 
		ON table_name.column_name = table_name2.column_name;

For example, suppose we have noticed super hero movies getting longer in recent years and we want
to see if there is a correlation between release year and runtime. We can craft a statement using
INNER JOIN to pull the runtime column and the year column from movie_stats and movie_info, 
respectively. Let's also suppose we want to know if there is a correlation between the directors 
chosen for the movies and total earnings. We can get this information with a similar statement. 

For pratice, I'll leave it to you to come up with examples for LEFT OUTER JOIN and RIGHT OUTER JOIN
based on your own tables.
