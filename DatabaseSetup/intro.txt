Hey Everyone!

Today we will be going over how to install and configure MariaDB on Red Hat Enterprise's CentOS 7.

For this video we'll be using the same virtual machine I set up in my last video 'Installing a LAMP 
Stack on CentOS 7'. You can find the link to that video down below.

To begin, I'll go over some background information on databases and the history of MariaDB. Then I'll 
show how to install MariaDB and set up basic configuration options. Moreover, we'll cover how to do 
database operations that you commonly see in practice. To finish, I'll go over primary and foreign 
keys along with examples of how they work.  

Let's begin!
