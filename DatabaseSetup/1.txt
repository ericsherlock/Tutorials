First, let's go over some background information on relational databases and MariaDB. 

A database is a structured collection of data stored for use by one or more applications. A relational database 
enables the creation of multiple tables tied together by a unique identifier that is present in all tables. The 
building block of a relational database is a table of data, consisting of rows and columns. Each column holds a
particular type of data in which each row contains a specific value for each column.  

MariaDB is an open source relational database management system that is rooted in MySQL. MySQL AB was a Swedish
company that was acquired by Sun Microsystems in 2008 and subsequently by Oracle in 2010. The MySQL development
team wanted to maintain an open source version of the popoular database system but Oracle wanted to create a 
commercial database system for enterprise (which became Oracle Database Server).

As a result a number of MySQL engineers who still wanted an open-source alternative then decided to create a 
fork of MySQL and created MariaDB which remains free and open source software under the GNU General Public 
License.  

Now that we have some background information let's begin with installation and configuration.
