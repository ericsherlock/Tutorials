On the screen there are three terminals. The top right is an SSH connection to the CentOS 7 VM that we 
set up in my last video "Installing LAMP on CentOS 7" (Link in description). The bottom right is a 
terminal that shows all the commands I'll be using to create and fill my example database. Whereas, the 
current window will show formal command syntax and command explanations.

Let's start by installing MariaDB: 

			sudo yum install mariadb-server

Once It's finished installing we can check the status with:

			sudo systemctl status mariadb

It should not be running, so we can start it wtih:
	
			sudo systemctl start mariadb

If we want it to continue to run through reboots, we will need to enable the service with:

			sudo systemctl enable mariadb

Now we can go over some basic configuration options by running the following: 

			sudo mysql_secure_installation
