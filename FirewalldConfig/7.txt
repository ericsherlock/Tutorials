For example, the following opens basic ports/services that allow internet traffic
(HTTP / HTTPS), email services (SMTP), and a way to connect with our server via SSH

			sudo firewall-cmd --add-service=http
			sudo firewall-cmd --add-service=https
			sudo firewall-cmd --add-service=ssh
			sudo firewall-cmd --add-service=smtp

To make sure these have been added to the runtime configuration, view the services:

			sudo firewall-cmd --list-services

Now suppose we want to change the SSH port to something other than 22; say 1234.
We can use the following commands:

	--> Close / Remove current SSH port and service
			sudo firewall-cmd --remove-service=ssh

	--> Open new port for SSH to begin using 
			sudo firewall-cmd --add-port=1234/tcp

**Note, If you're trying to change the SSH port, make sure the same port
is also open on the server you are trying to connect to. So if you change 
your SSH port to 1234 on your machine, then port 1234 MUST be open on the
computer you are trying to connect to.

Let's also suppose we want to remove access to email services, you could use:

			sudo firewall-cmd --remove-service=smtp

Suppose you don't remember the service name but do remember the port number, you
could also use the following to acheive the same result:

			sudo firewall-cmd --remove-port=25/tcp
