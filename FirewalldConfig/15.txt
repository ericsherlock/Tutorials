As a last aside before defining our firewall rules, take careful
note of the following:

************Notes: Please pay particular attention**************

		--> ORDER DOES MATTER: The order in which you append/insert 
			your rules can determine the overall effectiveness of 
			your firewall. This is becuase each rule determines how
			to handle a particular type of packet. But if there is a 
			packet that doesn't match with any rules, a "default"
			rule is used for that packet. If your default rule is to 
			accept (or reject) all packets, then any packet that doesn't
			match a defined rule will automatically be accepted (or 
			rejected). Which can quickly become a security concern.

		--> MAKE SURE NOT TO LOCK YOURSELF OUT: It is easy
			for those new to IPTables to lock themselves out 
			of their own systems. It is common on initial setup
			to see people first define a defult rule to block all 
			traffic then add only a few rules for the traffic they
			want to accept. Only to find out they mis-configured or
			didn't test properly and are now locked out. So be careful
			not to add default rules that block or deny traffic until 
			you're ready. It's much easier to initally allow all 
			traffic and simply insert a rule to deny all traffic once
			you're finished defining your other rules.
