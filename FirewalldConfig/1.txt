To begin, let's get some background information on firewalls so we can better understand
the overall structure of a firewall and how they work.

For this information I'll be turning to the 'Linux Bible' by Christopher Negus 
which is an incredibly extensive and thorough accounting of all things Linux 
and is definitly worth buying if you can (link below):

Let's start by explaining firewalls:
	
	"A Firewall for a computer blocks the transmission of malicious or unwanted data 
	into and out of a computer system or network."

In other terms, a firewall is a filter that inspects each packet coming to/from
a network. It then chooses what to do with that packet based on the contents inside.

There are multiple types of firewall:
		--> Network or Host based
		--> Hardware or software based
		--> Network-layer or Application-layer filte
