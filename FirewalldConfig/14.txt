Defining IPTable rules tends to be daunting, in part, because
the IPTables commands generally need multiple options for even
a single rule. But this also affords you fine-grained control
over your firewall and its implementation.

Here, I'll list the most used options and what they do. (You can
also see these options on the IPTables manual page).

--> OPTIONS:
		-t --> specifies the table to operate on
		-P --> Sets overall policy for a given chain
		-A --> Append a rule to a particular chain
		-I --> Inserts appended rule into specific location
		-D --> Delete a rule from a given chain
		-j --> If rule criteria is met, jump to target
		-s --> apply rule to source IP
		-p --> apply rule to protocol 
		-m --> applies rule to designated network state
		-dport --> apply rule to a designated port number
		-sport --> apply rule to a source port number

Now, let's begin.
