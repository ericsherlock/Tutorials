This covers the very basics of Firewalld. There are much more advanced configuration
options available that allow you to create any firewall to fit your needs. To see
these options, again, consult the Firewalld documentation:

That's it for today. If you have any questions or concerns, let me know
in the comments section.

Thanks for watching!
