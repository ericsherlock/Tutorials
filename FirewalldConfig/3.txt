Now we can begin with Firewalld.

According to the Firewalld man page: 
		
		Firewalld provides a dynamically managed firewall with support for 
		network/firewall zones to define the trust level of network connections 
		or interfaces.

Here, a 'zone' refers to a particular trust level of a network connection.
Based on things like source IP or incoming network interface, traffic is 
directed to the appropriate zone. Where each zone can have varying ports 
open that allow different types of traffic depending on that traffic's trust level.

Firewalld comes with pre-defined zones like dmz, internal, public,
trusted, and external to name a few. Administrators can even define
their own zones to suit their needs. 

To get more information on zones and other configuration options refer to the 
Firewalld documentation, here:
