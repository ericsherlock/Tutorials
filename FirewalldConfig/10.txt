Now that we have learned how to install and configure Firewalld, we
can start on doing the same for IPTables. 

According to the IPTables man page: 

			IPTables/IP6Tables is an administration tool for IPv4 and IPv6
			packet filtering and network address translation (NAT).

To install IPTables, we can use the standard repositories
(Parrot OS Terminal is Bottom window to the left):

			sudo apt install iptables

Once it's finished installing, we can list all the current IPTable rules:

			sudo iptables -L
