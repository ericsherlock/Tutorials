Now that we have some background information on Firewalld we can start 
with installation and configuration. In no particular order, we'll walk 
over how to do things like:
			--> Install firewalld package
			--> Enable system services
			--> Add / Remove Ports and Services
			--> Configure zones

To begin let's install the Firewalld package (window to the right):

		sudo dnf install firewalld

Once it is finished installing, we can check the state of the firewall with:

		sudo firewall-cmd --state
