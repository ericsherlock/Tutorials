The previous configuration changes will only work for the current runtime
session. To make any changes permanent through reboots we will need to
add the '--permanent' flag to each command. 

****PLEASE NOTE: Something that can get confusing is when the changes are made 
permanently vs in runtime. If you make changes with the '--permanent' option
you MUST reload the firewall before you will see these changes take place. If 
you make changes to the current runtime configuration, the changes will 
take place immediately. I'll show a quick example of this by adding
 the smtp service to the default configuration 

	--> **Note: My starting configuration has only the HTTPS and SSH 
			    services currently defined.

--> See current default config:     firewall-cmd --list-services 
--> Add smtp to default config:     firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=smtp
--> Smtp not added to config:       firewall-cmd --list-services
--> Reload the firewall:            firewall-cmd --reload
--> Smtp now added to config:       firewall-cmd --list-services

***ALSO NOTE: It can also be confusing when you reload the firewall only to 
see the changes you made have been erased. This will happen when changes are 
made to the firewalld runtime configuration but not the default configuration. 
This means that whenever you reload the firewall, any temporary changes to the 
runtime configuration will be erased and the rules that were active in the default 
configuration will return. I'll show an example of this by removing the 'smtp' 
service and adding 'http' service. These changes will take place immediately in 
the runtime configuration but replaced by the default configuration on firewall reload:

--> Remove smtp from runtime config:              firewall-cmd --remove-service=smtp
--> Add http to runtime config:                   firewall-cmd --add-service=http
--> Smtp erased & http added to runtime config:   firewall-cmd --list-services
--> Smtp & http will be erased at reload:         firewall-cmd --reload
--> Changes replaced upon default config reload:  firewall-cmd --list-services
