Go back to the 'Intercept' tab to the left. 

Now, open a Firefox tab to a website. I'll use Google. (If you haven't turned it off already,
Make sure the 'Intercept is off' button is set to 'Intercept is off' in BurpSuite.) 

In your Firefox window, go to the FoxyProxy icon and click on it so that it shows you a list of options.
Click on the proxy option you set up earlier. I named the proxy 'Burp' so I'll click on the 
'Use proxy Burp for all URLs (ignore patters)'. 

Also go back to BurpSuite and turn the 'Intercept is off' to 'Intercept is on'.
