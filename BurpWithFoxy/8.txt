Now, we need to congfigure BurpSuite to intercept the traffic from the web browser. More specifically,
we need to make sure that BurpSuite is configured to intercept the traffic that is coming from
localhost. 

Go ahead and open BurpSuite to a Temporary project. 

Along the top you will see a series of tabs starting with 'Target', 'Proxy', 'Spider'..etc

Navigate to the 'Proxy' tab. 

Go ahead and click 'Intercept is on' Button to so that it reads 'Intercept is off'. 

Just above this button you will see a subset of tabs starting with 'Intercept', 'HTTP history',
'WebSockets history', and 'Options'. 

Click on the 'Options' Tab.
