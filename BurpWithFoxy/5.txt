First, we will download the FoxyProxy addon within Firefox.
You can find the download page here: 
	
			https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/foxyproxy-standard/?src=search

Note: This download is for FoxyProxy Standard. There is also a FoxyProxy Basic download in the
Firefox addon list that will also work but comes preinstalled with less configuration options.

A popup will appear asking if FoxyProxy has permission to access browser information. Click
'Add' and allow FoxyProxy to finish installing.
