Accoring to the FoxyProxy FAQ page (https://help.getfoxyproxy.org/index.php/knowledge-base/foxyproxy-faq) 
"FoxyProxy is a Firefox extension which automatically switches an internet connection across one or more 
proxy servers based on URL patterns. Simply put, FoxyProxy automates the manual process of editing Firefox's 
Connection Settings dialog."

In general a proxy server is a gateway between a user and the internet. Using a proxy server can provide 
privacy and security by shielding internal users from external sources by forcing traffic through
a middle man.
