Now, navigate back to the 'Intercept' Tab in BurpSuite and turn 'Intercept is off' to 'Intercept is on'

You should now be able to intercept traffic successfully. 

To return normal traffic flow, simply click again on the FoxyProxy icon and choose
'Turn off FoxyProxy (Use Firefox Settings)'. Also make sure to turn 'Intercept is on' 
to 'Intercept is off' in BurpSuite.  

You have successfully configured FoxyProxy with BurpSuite!

Now if you ever need to intercept internet traffic through BurpSuite, all you need to do is 
toggle the FoxyProxy options to point toward your Burp proxy. 

That's it for now.

Thanks for watching.
