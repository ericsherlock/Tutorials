For the configuration options:

	--> Title: is optional, so name it what ever you want (I'll name it Burp).
	--> Proxy Type: HTTP
	--> IP Address: 127.0.0.1
	--> Port: 8080

There is also an 'On/Off' slider that reads 'Do not use for localhost and intranet/private IP addresses'. 
Make sure you slide this to 'Off'. We need this off because BurpSuite is running on our localhost and 
we'll need our traffic to go through it.

Press 'Save' below the input boxes to save the proxy settings.
