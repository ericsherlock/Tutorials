For penetration testers, BurpSuite (or OWASP ZAP) is a must have tool for any security testing job. It is an 
interception proxy that has the ability to inspect and modify traffic, scan applications for vulnerabilities, 
write your own plugins, and much more. BurpSuite acts an an intermediary for all traffic between a penetration
tester and the application they're testing.

It has both a paid and free version that can be downloaded here: https://portswigger.net/burp

One task that quickly becomes a nuisance when security testing is continuously having to re-configure the 
Firefox Network Proxy to route traffic through BurpSuite.

This is where FoxyProxy comes in.
