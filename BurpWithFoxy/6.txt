When the install completes, you should see the FoxyProxy icon in the upper right corner of the 
Firefox browser window. 

If you click on the icon you will see a popup box that indicates FoxyProxy is off and using the 
Firefox default network configuration settings reading "Turn off FoxyProxy (Use Firefox Settings)". 

Click on the 'Options' button at the bottom of the popup window. The FoxyProxy configuration window will
open, showing a list of options on the left hand side.

To add a new proxy, click the 'Add' button in the top left. A new page will appear with the inputs 
for your configuration options.
