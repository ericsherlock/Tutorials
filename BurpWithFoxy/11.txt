It is common to get an error message saying 'Your connection is not secure' (Like shown here).
This means we'll need to download and import the BurpSuite CA certificate in to Firefox.
	*Note: If you have already imported the BurpSuite CA certificate, then you are done and
			should be able to intercept traffic successfully)

To begin the import, download the BurpSuite CA certificate by completing the following:

	--> In BurpSuite turn 'Intercept is on' to 'Intercept is off'

	--> Go back to Firefox and make sure FoxyProxy is still set to 'Use proxy Burp for all URLs'

	--> Open a new tab in Firefox and go to: http://burp (Note: there is NO 'www' or .com/.net..etc)

	--> You should see a simple web page that says 'Burp Suite Community Edition' at the top of the page
			--> In the top right, click on the 'CA Certificate' text and download the CA Certificate.
