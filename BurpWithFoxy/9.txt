We should see a set of our Proxy listeners.

Like the description under 'Proxy Listeners' says, we need to configure our browser to use 
one of the listeners as its proxy server.

If you see an interface already running on localhost interface (127.0.0.1:8080) then we are done 
and can go back to the 'Intercept' tab to the left. 

If you do not see an interface already running, click on the 'Add' button next to the interfaces box.
 This will bring up an 'Add a new proxy listener' window. 

You should see a box with 'Bind to port: ' dialog next to it along with 'Bind to address' radio buttons.
Enter the following: 

--> Bind to port: 8080
--> Bind to address: 'Loopback only'

Click 'OK' in the bottom right. You should now see the localhost interface in your interfaces list.
