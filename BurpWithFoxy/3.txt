To help illustrate, I'll use a scene from the popular movie Goodfellas. In one of the openeing scenes
the main character Henry Hill explains how Paulie feels about phones: 

"Paulie hated phones. He wouldn't have one in his house. He used to get all his calls second hand,
then you'd have to call the people back from an outside phone. There were guys, that's all they did
all day long was take care of Paulie's phone calls."

In this scenario, Paulie is the internal user and the phone calls he gets are internet traffic. Here,
the guys that Paulie continously has take his calls are the server proxies. They simply relay all
information between Paulie and the outside world.
