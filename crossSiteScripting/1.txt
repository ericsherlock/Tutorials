For this example, let's suppose we have found a banking site (DVWA) that we want to exploit with cross-site scripting. More specifically, we will attempt a stored XSS attack.

Let's suppose the first page we want to exploit has 'Low' security. 

If we look at the source code for this page above, we can see that the only sanitization that is done on the 'Message' field is a 'stripslashes()' method. If we look this up, we learn that 'stripslashes()' returns a string with backslashes stripped off.
