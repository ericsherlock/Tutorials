Before we continue, we need to turn back on BurpSuite to intercept packets, so change the "Intercept is..." button to "Intercept is ON"

Now if we click on one of the malicious links, we will see the request in our BurpSuite window. 

Inspecting this request we can see the attackers passwords are being set. We can also see that the referer is our own server, and not the Bank's (DVWA) server.

We need to paste into the referer field the referer link that we copied earlier.

Once we make these changes, we can click on the 'Forward' button on BurpSuite.
