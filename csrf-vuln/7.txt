As we can see our request was sent through to the Bank's (DVWA) server. We also received a 'Password Changed' dialog.

Thus, we have sent the attacker's malicious request to the victim's banking website, successfully changing the victim's password. 

The banking site accepts the request because the user is still authenticated with the bank website on their browser.

**Make sure to toggle the 'Intercept is...' button to 'Intercept is Off' and reset the Firefox preferences back to 'Auto-detect proxy settings for this network' to return to normal web traffic.**
