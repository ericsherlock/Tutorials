First, let's send a password changing request from our banking site (DVWA). 

Now, we can see the intercepted request on our BurpSuite window.

If we inspect the raw GET request, we can see that the new password and password confirmation are being set in clear text. A few lines below this, we can also see the referer, or the server that sends the request. 

Let's copy the GET request AND the referer link from the captured request. When we copy the GET request, change the user password to our own password.
